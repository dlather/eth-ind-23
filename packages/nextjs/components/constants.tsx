      question: "How to choose a data provider ?",
      answer:
        "Data providers with high bond value, low provider fees, suitable End Time stamp and optimum assertion liveness window should be preffered. The tradeoff to setting a higher bond is that it may be more difficult to run a project that requires frequent proposals, since good proposers will have funds locked up for at least the length of the challenge window. Another tradeoff is that a very high bond may make it difficult for disputers to post bonds to challenge bad proposals. Remember also that disputers will lose their bond if they are incorrect, so the disputer has a capital cost and a risk of loss.",
